			Sean started watching football in 1998. He said watching <b><em>Zinedine Zidane</em></b> win France World Cup 98' really captivated him to watch this beautiful game. Then came 2005, when Sean first saw <b><em>Ronaldinho</em></b> play for <b><em>FC Barcelona</em></b> against archrival <b><em>Real Madrid</em></b>, he immediately felt in love with club football and was a big fan of the game ever since.<!--  kind of odd considering he was a fan of Zidane first --> Sean cannot thank football enough because that is where he met his wife as well. She is an avid support of football as well.

			Guus Hiddink: born 8 November 1946) is a former Dutch footballer and current manager. He is recognised for winning the European treble (Eredivisie, Dutch Cup and European Cup) with PSV Eindhoven; leading South Korea to a fourth place finish in the 2002 FIFA World Cup; managing the Netherlands into the same position in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, losing to eventual runner-up Brazil on penalties; leading Australia to the second round at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, their first appearance in the tournament for 32 years; leading Russia to the semi-finals of Euro 2008, Russia's best performance since the breakup of the Soviet Union; and reviving Chelsea by winning the FA Cup in 2009 against Everton. He is currently the manager of Russia. However, Hiddink's team failed to qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup finals, putting Hiddink's future in doubt. Hiddink previously managed De Graafschap, PSV Eindhoven, Fenerbah√ße, Valencia, the Netherlands, Real Madrid, Real Betis, South Korea, Australia, and Chelsea.
